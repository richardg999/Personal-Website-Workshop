# Personal-Website-Workshop

## Setup (for beginners)

1. Install VS Code (or your favorite text editor)
2. Recommended: Download the VS Code extension "Live Server". Click on Extensions button on side panel and search for "Live Server".
3. Create a GitHub account if you don't have one already.
4. Install GitHub desktop (or use Git CLI if you already know how).
5. Create a new repository on GitHub. Name it "<github-username>.github.io". Initialize it with a README.
6. Then on the respository page, click "Clone or Download">"Open in Desktop".
7. Then launch VS Code. Click "File">"Open Folder" and open the local respository folder you just created (should be named "<github-username>.github.io")
8. There should be nothing inside except a README.md file. Now, you will create a new file called "index.html" and another new filed called "style.css". (Right click > "New file" to create new files).
9. Copy and paste the code from this repository's index.html file into the index.html file you created. This is just some starter code that sets up the website.
